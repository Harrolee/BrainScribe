# SDK Examples
By importing `LooxidLinkSDKExamples.unitypackage` to your Unity project, you can run some Looxid Link examples.

## 2D Visualizer
This example demonstrates the usage of the APIs related to the device status, raw signal, EEG feature index, mind index, and other data provided in the SDK in 2D form. You can use this as a reference to see how you can visualize your data in the Looxid Link SDK.

## 3D Visualizer
This example demonstrates the usage of the APIs in 3D form. You can see the respective graphs for the data of each sensor, as well as the particle effect changes that are changing with the brainâ€™s activity.

## Interaction Playground
This is an example where you can use your biometric signals provided by the SDK to interact with the objects in the VR environment. By selecting the data that you want to link, you can see the boxes levitate and fall as the user's biometric signal changes.
