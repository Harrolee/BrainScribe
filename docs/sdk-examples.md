# SDK Examples
You can run some examples for the Looxid Link if you install `LooxidLinkSDKExamples.unitypackage` in the Unity project.

## 2D Visualizer
This example demonstrates the device status, raw signal, EEG feature index, and mind index, and other data provided in the SDK in 2D form. You can use this as a reference to see how you can visualize your data in the Looxid Link SDK.

## 3D Visualizer
This is an example of data displayed in 3D. You can see the respective graphs for the data of each sensor, as well as the particle effect changes that are changing with the brain’s activity.

## Interaction Playground
The interaction playground is an example where you can connect your biometric signals with the Looxid Link SDK. By selecting the data that you want to link, you can observe the boxes levitate according to the changes in the user’s biosignals.
