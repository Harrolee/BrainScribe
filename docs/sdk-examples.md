# SDK Examples
By importing `LooxidLink_Unity_SteamVR_Examples.*.*.unitypackage` to your Unity project, you can run some Looxid Link examples. The Unity package file is available to download from [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/LooxidLabs/link-sdk/releases/).

!> These examples require Unity 2019.1 or later.

## 2D Visualizer
This example demonstrates the usage of the data provided by the Link SDK (e.g. device status, raw signal, EEG feature index, and mind index) in 2D form. You can use this as a reference to see how you can visualize your data in the Looxid Link SDK.

## 3D Visualizer
This example demonstrates the usage of the data provided by the Link SDK in 3D form. You can see the respective graphs for the data of each sensor, as well as the particle effect changes that are changing with the brainâ€™s activity.

## Interaction Playground
This is an example where you can use your biometric signals provided by the SDK to interact with the objects in the VR environment. By selecting the data that you want to link, you can see the boxes levitate and fall as the user's biometric signal changes.
