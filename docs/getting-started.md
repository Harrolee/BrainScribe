### For Oculus Rift S users
1. Make sure you have all of the following along with your VR system:
  - Looxid Link Hub
  - Looxid Link Hub Mounter for Oculus Rift S
  - Looxid Link EEG Pad for Oculus Rift S
  - Looxid Link EEG Pad Mounter for Oculus Rift S *(already attached to the EEG Pad)*
  - USB 2.0 to Micro-B 5-pin cable
  - Velcro cable ties
2. The picture below shows the names of the components connected to the EEG Pad, which you should use as reference throughout the instructions.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-01]
3. Take the Hub Mounter and place it over the bridge that holds the lenses and the headband of the Oculus Rift S together. As shown in the image below, the mounter should perfectly fit the headband bridge.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-02]
  - Make sure that the protruding parts that are used for holding the Hub (#1) is facing away from the headset.
  - Make sure that the protruding parts that are used for holding the Link Pad and connect to the Oculus Rift S (#2) are placed on the bridge.
  - Make sure that the body of the Hub Mounter is aligned with the bridge on the Oculus Rift S.
4. Before you place the EEG Pad on to the headset, make sure to pull the headband away from the lenses as far as it will go. Press on the button on the lower side of the headset and carefully pull on the headband. This will give you enough space for the EEG Pad to be placed on the device.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-03]
5. Facing the inside of the headset, position the EEG Pad facing in your direction so that four sensors are on the bottom. Hold the attached magnetic connector with your other hand.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-04]
6. Carefully place the cable of the magnetic connector between the headband and the lenses so that it passes through the gap.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-05]
7. Make sure that the protruding parts of the EEG Pad Mounter are aligned with the part of the Hub Mounter that attaches to the bridge of the headset.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-06]
8. The protruding parts of the EEG Pad Mounter should match evenly with the respective slots on both sides of the Hub Mounter. If the protruding parts are not placed properly in the slots of the Hub Mounter, the EEG Pad will be loose and might fall apart.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-07]
9. Take the magnetic connector and align it with the respective slot on the Hub as shown below.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-08]
10. Insert the protruding parts of the Hub Mounter into the respective slots on the Hub.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-09]
11. Once you place all the pieces together, your Looxid Link should look like as shown below.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-10]
12. Connect the Micro-B end of the cable to the corresponding slot on the Hub. When connecting the Micro-B port, make sure the slider knob is off.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-11]
13. Since the Micro-B to USB cable is quite long, you will have to wrap it to the cable line that is used to power the Oculus Rift S, as shown below.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-12]
14. Take the Velcro cable ties and wrap them as shown below. Place them between 50 to 70cm apart from each other so that the cable lines do not tangle up while you use your headset.
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-13]
![][connect-looxid-link-to-oculus-rift-s-14]
15. Turn the slider knob of the Hub on and check the LED lighting.
  - If the switch color is red, it means the power is OFF and the LED light won’t turn on.
  - If the switch color is green, it means the power is ON and the LED light will turn on.
  - Do not push the slider with excessive force.
